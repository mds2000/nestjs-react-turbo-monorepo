# Monorepo Turbo + NestJS + React

Welcome to my Monorepo Starter Kit! This repository is designed to kickstart your projects with ease, leveraging the power of Turbo. The backend is built on NestJS, a versatile and scalable Node.js framework, while the frontend is powered by React with Vitu for seamless integration.

## Technologies Used

### Turbo <br><a href="https://turbo.build/" target="blank"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4060187/196936104-5797972c-ab10-4834-bd61-0d1e5f442c9c.png" width="120" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Turbo is a tool for building and managing monorepos, enabling efficient code sharing and dependency management across multiple packages or projects. It simplifies development workflows by providing robust tools for managing dependencies, running commands across packages, and ensuring consistent configurations.

### NestJS <br><a href="https://nestjs.com/" target="blank"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" width="120" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework that utilizes TypeScript to build efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It follows the modular architecture and design patterns inspired by Angular, making it highly adaptable for building complex backend systems. NestJS offers features such as dependency injection, middleware integration, and built-in support for GraphQL and WebSockets.

### React <br><a href="https://nestjs.com/" target="blank"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/React-icon.svg/2300px-React-icon.svg.png" width="120" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive UI components efficiently. React's component-based architecture promotes reusability and modularity, making it an ideal choice for building modern web applications.

### Vitu <br><a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="blank"><img src="https://vitejs.dev/logo.svg" width="120" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Vitu is a lightweight library that enhances React development by providing utilities for managing state, handling side effects, and simplifying data fetching. It offers a declarative approach to managing application logic, reducing boilerplate code and improving developer productivity.
